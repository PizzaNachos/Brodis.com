            <h2>First An argument against Soda</h2>
            <h3>Sugar content</h3>
            <p>First, we will look at some facts about other drinks, mainly sodas. 
                The average 20oz soda has 
                <a href="https://www.coca-colaproductfacts.com/en/products/coca-cola/original/20-oz/">65</a> 
                grams of sugar in it. One soda per day for a week puts 455 grams of sugar 
                into your body per week. That is over one <strong>Pound</strong> of sugar 
                put into your body per week. Juices have an extreemly similar ammount of sugar 
                with 20oz of apple juice having 55 grams of sugar in it.
                Even "Healthy" juices such as 
                <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/healthiest-juice#1.-Cranberry">Cranberry juice and pomegranite juice</a>
                both have more 
                <a href="https://www.fatsecret.com/calories-nutrition/usda/cranberry-juice-cocktail-(bottled)?portionid=45046&portionamount=20.000">sugar than soda.</a>
            </p>


            <h3>Sugar Effects</h3>
            <p>
                Ok so what? a pound of sugar a week certinly sounds bad but what are the 
                <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/too-much-sugar#section1">practical effects of that?</a>
                <ul>

                    <li>Celular and Skin aging</li>
                </ul>
                Now that we know the hard science on an increased ammount of sugar in your 
                diet what happens <a href="https://www.medibank.com.au/livebetter/be-magazine/food/8-benefits-of-cutting-back-on-sugar/">if you reduce that?</a>

            </p>

            <h3>Diet Sodas?</h3>
            <p>
                As we have seen both sodas and juices are bad as they have an imense ammount of sugar, but what about diet sodas? or other "healthy" drinks with sugar 
                substutes? These unfortunatly may have even worse side effects than sugar and weight gain. Due to the way our bodies deal with these unnatural man made 
                chemicals they can lead to a <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325919.php#is-diet-soda-bad-for-you">host of problems</a> including.
